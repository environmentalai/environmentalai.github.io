# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore the use of Artificial intelligence methods for environmental problems. 

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Photocatalysis.** Data-driven modeling of wastewater treatment using photocatalysis.


**Adsorption.** Use of machine learning and deep learning tools to simulate adsorption of various pollutants (heavy metals, dyes, P) onto biochar for wastewater treatment.

### ... and more.
